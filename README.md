## About the data

<a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf">The Ames Housing dataset</a> was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. It is a classic dataset used in data science education and can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data">kaggle</a>.
